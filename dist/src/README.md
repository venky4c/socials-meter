## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

There are a few known issues with the implementation. Despite my best efforts, with my current state of understanding of the technologies, I am not able to achieve the following.

1. The instagram top border shows up as white/black instead of the linear gradient of yellow to red.
2. The Cards are not showing border-radius on bottom.
3. All the 12 cards are not responsive to the extent required. As a workaround, the top 4 cards are rendered with overflow as 'auto'
4. The background color for the top 4 cards could not be implemented as per design. Even though, I tried to add a dummy row to the header, the background color is not extending to this dummy row for some reason.
5. The trends for the last 8 cards are showing up on the bottom LHS in Chrome. In Firefox, it shows as per design. I am not sure why.
